# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow lets you generate SLSA provenance file for your project.
# The generation satisfies level 3 for the provenance requirements - see https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements
# The project is an initiative of the OpenSSF (openssf.org) and is developed at
# https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator.
# The provenance file can be verified using https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.
# For more information about SLSA and how it improves the supply-chain, visit slsa.dev.
